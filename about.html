            Our Story
        </h1>
        <p class="about-p">
            Founded by the Fishel family decades ago, our shop began as a small stand by the lake, offering locals a refreshing escape from the summer heat. Today, we've grown into a
            beloved community gathering spot, where visitors of all ages come to enjoy our artisanal ice creams, sorbets, and specialty frozen delights. Each recipe is crafted with
            love, using locally sourced ingredients and family traditions passed down through the years.
